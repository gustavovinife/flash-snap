# Future Considerations

Based on the Architecture Decision Record, the following enhancements are planned for future releases:

## Offline Support
- Implement offline mode with local caching when Supabase is unavailable
- Provide seamless synchronization when connection is restored
- Consider IndexedDB or similar browser storage solution for offline data

## Template Improvements
- Allow template downloading from a server rather than bundling them with the app
- Reduce initial app size by moving templates to on-demand downloads
- Create versioning system for templates to support updates
- Implement a community-driven template marketplace or sharing platform

## User Experience Enhancements
- Implement customizable global shortcut settings on the Settings Page
- Allow users to configure their preferred review times
- Add notification system for review reminders
- Support for different learning algorithms beyond SM-2

## Technical Improvements
- Expand the reusable component library under `/ui` for better developer velocity
- Improve test coverage with unit and integration tests
- Consider migration to newer Electron versions as they become available
- Optimize bundle size for faster startup and better performance

## Additional Features
- Multi-device synchronization through Supabase
- Advanced statistics and learning analytics
- Collaboration features for shared decks
- Mobile companion app
