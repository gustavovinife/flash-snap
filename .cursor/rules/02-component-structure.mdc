# Component Structure

The application's UI components are organized into two main categories:

## Common UI Components
Located in `/src/renderer/src/ui/common`:
- `/Button` - Reusable button components
- `/Input` - Form input components
- `/Select` - Dropdown/select components

These components form the base UI library and should be used consistently across the application.

## Feature Components
Located in `/src/renderer/src/components`:
- Feature-specific components
- Business logic components
- Page-specific components

## Component Guidelines
1. Use TailwindCSS for styling
2. Keep components focused and single-responsibility
3. Leverage common UI components when possible
4. Include proper TypeScript types
5. Support i18n where text is involved

## Template Components
Located in `/src/renderer/src/ui/template`:
- Components specific to template rendering and management
- Template selection and import UI
