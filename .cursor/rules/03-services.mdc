# Services Architecture

Core services are located in `/src/renderer/src/services` and handle key application functionality:

## Core Services

### Review Service
- Implements SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm
- Manages card review scheduling
- Handles ease factor and interval calculations

### Storage Service
- Manages localStorage operations
- Handles card and deck persistence
- Future: Will support PostgreSQL sync

### Clipboard Service
- Manages text selection and copying
- Handles global shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + X)
- Facilitates quick card creation

## Service Guidelines
1. Services should be singleton instances
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for data models
3. Implement error handling and logging
4. Keep services focused and single-responsibility
5. Document public APIs and interfaces

## Data Models
```typescript
interface Card {
  id: string
  front: string
  back: string
  context?: string
  dueDate?: Date
  interval?: number
  easeFactor?: number
  repetition?: number
  nextReview?: Date
}

interface Deck {
  id: string
  name: string
  cards: Card[]
  createdAt: Date
  lastReviewed?: Date
  type: 'language' | 'knowledge'
}
```
